# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge

In this analysis, a data set from the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia conducted by the US National Eye Institute was used. Data preparation such as loading in the file and standardize the data was done first. After that, dimensionality reduction was apply to the data set. PCA was used first with at least maintaining 90% explained variance which reduce the feature from 14 to 10. T-SNE was further used to reduce the dataset dimensions. T-SNE reduce the feature from 10 to 2. When the T-SNE output is plotted on a graph, it looks like there is 5 clusters. Finally, a k-means cluster analysis was performed to identify the best number of clusters. A for loop was used to see all the inertia from range 1 to 10. 

### Recommendation
According to the elbow curve plotted above, it seems like the curve or inflection point is at 2 and 3 but the output from t-SNE looks like there is 5 clusters. From these results, a k of 2 to 5 should all be reasonable. While if we keep increasing k, there will still be a steady decrease in inertia but the decrease will be less and less each time. In the section below, I use KElbowVisualizer to determine what is the best k to use base on the distortion score. Distortion score measures the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned center. According to the result, 3 is the recommended number.
